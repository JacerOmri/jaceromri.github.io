<p>I am really excited to launch my new blog on wordpress.com!</p>
<p>i've chosen this service because it provides good functionality along with simplicity and ease of use (i am lazy remember?).</p>
<p>Basically i'm planning to talk about linux and open source in the first place, also other technology related stuff i have experienced (web, robotics, embedded...)</p>
<p>stay tuned and follow me everywhere, here, twitter, facebook... anywhere you want! you will just get my updates. Until then, wish me good luck :)</p>
